## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used the Airbnb Seattle datasets of the year 2016 to understand the below.

1. A glance at the availability of the listings in the year 2016.
2. The different property types and their counts.
3. The main factors that affects the price of a listing.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here. I have tried to find out the answers to the above three questions using these notebooks.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
